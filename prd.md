Lightweight DAM MVP - Product Requirements Document

1. Overview

1.1 Problem Statement

Sales teams at our customer organizations waste significant time searching for brand-compliant assets across multiple systems. This inefficiency reduces selling time and often results in outdated or off-brand materials being shared with prospects. Our CRM apps currently enable document creation but lack comprehensive asset management capabilities. This gap prevents some potential customers from adopting our solution, causing them to opt for competitors with full asset management functionality across all content types.

1.2 Proposed Solution

A lightweight Digital Asset Management (DAM) solution with its own standalone interface, separate from our existing CRM apps. This solution will provide comprehensive asset management capabilities while also offering API endpoints that can eventually be leveraged by our CRM apps to access and display assets directly within the CRM workflow.

1.3 Business Objectives

* Increase customer happiness by solving a critical workflow pain point
* Extend the value proposition of our existing CRM integrations
* Drive adoption of our brand template and data automation capabilities
* Create a foundation for future expansion into broader DAM functionality

1.4 Success Metrics

* Primary: Number of assets uploaded by marketing/admin teams within 30 days of launch
* Secondary: Percentage of sales reps accessing assets weekly within 60 days of launch
* Tertiary: Number of assets searched and shared through the system
* Business Impact: Reduction in time spent looking for assets (measured through user surveys)

2. Target Users

2.1 Primary User Personas

Marketing/Admin Team

* Responsible for uploading and organizing approved assets
* Maintains brand compliance and asset organization

* Needs to categorize and tag assets so sales teams can find relevant content for specific deals/prospects

Sales Representatives

* Needs to quickly find relevant, approved assets for specific prospects/deals
* Works primarily in the CRM environment
* Limited time and technical knowledge
* Requires simple, immediate access to the right content

2.2 Secondary User Personas

Sales Managers

* Want to ensure team has access to effective materials
* May need to upload team-specific content
* Interested in connecting asset usage to deal outcomes

Marketing Leadership

* Interest in asset usage analytics (nice-to-have)
* Wants visibility into which assets are being used effectively (nice-to-have)

3. MVP Scope and Requirements

7. System confirms successful upload and displays assets in admin library
8. Admin can review, organize and manage uploaded assets

4.2 Asset Search Flow

1. User navigates to asset library or search interface
2. User enters search term or browses folder structure
3. System displays matching assets as thumbnails with basic information
4. User can filter results by file type, upload date, or tags
5. User clicks on asset to view details

4.3 Asset Sharing Flow

1. User locates desired asset in library
2. User clicks "Share" button
3. User has option to include context parameters (e.g., CRM record IDs)
4. System generates shareable link with embedded context information
5. User can copy link or use it in external communications
6. System logs when link is accessed and captures available context data

4.5 Filter Category Management Flow

1. Admin navigates to filter category management section
2. Admin creates a new filter category (e.g., "Industry")
